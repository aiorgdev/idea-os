### Creating a Positioning Map

Plot competitors on a 2x2 matrix:

**Common Axes:**
- Price (low → high) vs Features (basic → advanced)
- Ease of use vs Power
- SMB focus vs Enterprise focus
- Generalist vs Specialist

**Example:**
```
                    HIGH PRICE
                         |
          Enterprise     |     Premium
          Complex        |     Powerful
                         |
SPECIALIST ----+----- GENERALIST
                         |
          Niche          |     Mass Market
          Simple         |     Basic
                         |
                    LOW PRICE
```

Find the empty quadrant or underserved position.

### Positioning Statement

Once you understand competitors:

```
For [target customer]
who [has this problem],
[Your product] is a [category]
that [key benefit].
Unlike [main competitor],
we [key differentiator].
```

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Only looking at direct competitors

**Problem:** Missing indirect competition (spreadsheets, manual processes)

**Fix:** Ask customers what they use today - it's often not a "competitor"

### 2. Overestimating your differentiation

**Problem:** "We're better because we're faster/cheaper/simpler"

**Fix:** Prove it. Get specific. "50% faster at [specific task]"

### 3. Ignoring the status quo

**Problem:** Not competing against "do nothing"

**Fix:** Remember: your biggest competitor is often inertia

### 4. Analysis paralysis

**Problem:** Spending weeks analyzing instead of talking to customers

**Fix:** Do initial analysis, then validate with customers

### 5. Static analysis

**Problem:** Analyzing once and forgetting

**Fix:** Update quarterly or when major changes happen

## Using Analysis for Strategy

### Find Your Angle

Based on competitor weaknesses:

1. **Underserved segment** - Who are they ignoring?
2. **UX gaps** - What's frustrating about existing tools?
3. **Feature gaps** - What's missing?
4. **Price gaps** - Is there room for cheaper or premium?
5. **Service gaps** - Is support terrible?

### Validate with Customers

Your competitor analysis is hypotheses until validated:

1. Ask in interviews: "What do you use for [problem]?"
2. "What do you like about [competitor]?"
3. "What's missing?"
4. "Why haven't you switched?"
