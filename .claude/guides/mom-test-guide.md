# The Mom Test - Complete Interview Guide

A guide to conducting customer interviews that give you real insights, not false validation.

## Why "Mom Test"?

The name comes from a simple rule: **Could you ask this question to your mom and get useful data?**

Your mom loves you. She'll say your idea is great even if it isn't. Bad questions get bad answers from everyone - they're just too polite to tell you the truth.

The Mom Test helps you ask questions that even your mom can't lie about.

## The Three Rules

### Rule 1: Talk about their life, not your idea

**Bad:** "Would you use an app that does X?"
**Good:** "How do you currently handle X?"

Why: People are terrible at predicting their future behavior. They're good at describing their past behavior.

### Rule 2: Ask about specifics, not hypotheticals

**Bad:** "Would you pay for this?"
**Good:** "What do you currently pay for solutions to this problem?"

Why: Hypotheticals let people imagine best-case scenarios. Specifics reveal reality.

### Rule 3: Talk less, listen more

**Bad:** "So our solution does A, B, and C, and we think it would really help with..."
**Good:** "Tell me more about that."

Why: When you're pitching, they're being polite. When they're talking, you're learning.

## Question Types

### Questions About The Problem

These reveal if the problem is real and painful:

```
"Walk me through the last time you dealt with [problem]."
"What happened?"
"How did you feel about that?"
"What did you do next?"
"How much time did that take?"
"What was the most frustrating part?"
```

### Questions About Current Behavior

These reveal how they solve it today:

```
"How do you currently handle [task]?"
"What tools do you use for this?"
"Show me how you do it today." (if possible)
"What do you like about your current approach?"
"What don't you like?"
```

### Questions About Alternatives

These reveal what they've tried:

```
"Have you tried to find a solution for this?"
"What did you try?"
"Why didn't it work?"
"What would have made it work?"
"Are you still looking for something better?"
```

### Questions About Value

These reveal willingness to pay:

```
"What do you currently spend on [related area]?"
"Have you paid for solutions to this before?"
"What would it be worth to you if this problem went away?"
"What budget do you have for tools like this?"
```

### Questions About Decision Making

These reveal the buying process:

```
"Who else would need to be involved in a decision like this?"
"How have you bought similar tools in the past?"
"What would stop you from trying something new?"
"What would make you switch from your current solution?"
```

## Bad Questions to Avoid

### 1. "Would you...?" questions

```
❌ "Would you use this?"
❌ "Would you pay for this?"
❌ "Would you recommend this to a friend?"
```

These invite speculation. People will say yes to be polite.

### 2. Leading questions

```
❌ "Don't you think it would be great if...?"
❌ "Wouldn't it be better to...?"
❌ "You must hate it when...?"
```

These push people toward your expected answer.

### 3. Questions about the future

```
❌ "If we built this, would you use it?"
❌ "How much would you expect to pay?"
❌ "What features would you want?"
```

People can't accurately predict their future behavior.

### 4. Pitching disguised as questions

```
❌ "What if there was a product that did A, B, and C, and cost only $X?"
```

This is a pitch, not a question. You're not learning.

## Good Questions to Ask

### Opening Questions

```
"Tell me about how you currently handle [area]."
"What's the hardest part of your job related to [topic]?"
"Walk me through a typical day when [situation] happens."
```

### Follow-up Questions

```
"Can you tell me more about that?"
"What do you mean by [term they used]?"
"Why is that?"
"What happened next?"
"How did that make you feel?"
```

### Digging Deeper

```
"You mentioned [thing]. Can you give me a specific example?"
"When was the last time that happened?"
"What did you do about it?"
"What was the result?"
```

### Understanding Value

```
"How much time does this currently take you?"
"What happens if you don't do this?"
"What have you tried before?"
"How much did you spend on that?"
```

## Interview Structure

### Before the Interview

1. **Define your goal**: What do you want to learn?
2. **Prepare 5-7 questions**: Based on your goal
3. **Research the person**: Understand their context
4. **Set expectations**: "This isn't a sales call, I'm just learning"

### During the Interview (30-45 min)

**Opening (5 min)**
- Thank them for their time
- Explain you're researching [topic], not selling
- Ask permission to take notes

**Core Questions (20-30 min)**
- Start with broad context questions
- Dig into problems they mention
- Ask about current solutions
- Explore value and willingness to pay

**Closing (5 min)**
- Ask for referrals
- Ask if you can follow up
- Thank them again

### After the Interview

1. **Write notes immediately**: Within 30 minutes
2. **Capture direct quotes**: Use their words
3. **Note surprises**: What was unexpected?
4. **Assess**: Was this validation or invalidation?
5. **Log with /interviews add**: Keep records

## Commitment Signals

Not all validation is equal. Look for these escalating signals:

### Weak Signals (Don't Trust These)

```
"That sounds interesting."
"I would definitely use that."
"You should talk to my friend, he might be interested."
```

These are politeness, not commitment.

### Medium Signals (Getting Warmer)

```
"Can you email me when it's ready?"
"I'd be interested in trying it."
"What's the timeline?"
```

Some interest, but still no commitment.

### Strong Signals (Real Validation)

```
"When can I get it?"
"Can I pay now to reserve a spot?"
"I'll introduce you to the buyer at my company."
"Can you send a proposal?"
```

These show genuine intent, not just interest.

### Strongest Signals

```
They give you money (even a small deposit)
They introduce you to decision-makers
They spend time showing you their current process
They share internal documents or data
```

These require real effort from them - that's commitment.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Talking too much

**Problem:** You explain your idea for 10 minutes, then ask "What do you think?"

**Fix:** Talk less than 30% of the time. Use short questions, then listen.

### Mistake 2: Seeking validation

**Problem:** You only hear what you want to hear.

**Fix:** Actively look for reasons your idea might fail. Ask "What would make you NOT use this?"

### Mistake 3: Pitching too early

**Problem:** You start explaining your solution before understanding their problem.

**Fix:** Don't mention your solution until you've fully explored their problem and current solutions.

### Mistake 4: Accepting vague answers

**Problem:** "Yeah, that's a problem" - and you move on.

**Fix:** Always ask for specifics. "Can you give me an example?" "When was the last time?"

### Mistake 5: Wrong people

**Problem:** You interview friends and family.

**Fix:** Interview actual potential customers who have the problem and budget.

## How Many Interviews?

**Minimum:** 5 interviews

**Ideal:** 10-15 interviews

**Signs you have enough:**
- You're hearing the same problems repeatedly
- You can predict answers before they say them
- No new surprising information

**Signs you need more:**
- Every interview surprises you
- Answers are contradictory
- You're not confident in patterns

## Interview Logistics

### Finding People to Interview

- LinkedIn (search for job titles)
- Industry forums and communities
- Twitter/X (people discussing the problem)
- Personal network (ask for intros)
- Cold email (explain you're researching, not selling)
- Events and meetups

### Getting Them to Say Yes

```
Subject: Quick research question about [topic]

Hi [Name],

I'm researching how [target customer type] handle [problem area].
I'm not selling anything - just learning.

Would you have 20 minutes for a quick call?
I'd love to hear about your experience with [specific topic].

Happy to share what I learn from other [role] if useful.

[Your name]
```

### During the Interview

- Video call or phone is fine
- Ask permission to record (if helpful)
- Take notes (or have someone else take notes)
- Don't use slides or demos
- Be genuinely curious

## Using Interview Data

After each interview, use `/interviews add` to log:

1. Who they are (role, company type)
2. Key problems they mentioned
3. Current solutions they use
4. Pain level (critical → low)
5. Interest in your solution
6. Direct quotes
7. Your overall assessment

After 5+ interviews, use `/interviews analyze` to find patterns.

## Summary

The Mom Test is simple:

1. **Ask about their life, not your idea**
2. **Ask about specifics, not hypotheticals**
3. **Listen more than you talk**
4. **Look for commitment, not compliments**

Do this, and you'll get honest feedback that helps you build something people actually want.
